# Modern-React-and-Redux

Code from the Modern React and Redux couse by Stephen Grider at
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux)

## Differences from Stephen

I will be making React functional components with hooks from the start of the course,
not class based components.

If Stephen uses cource control, I will be checking my code in much more often than him,
usually at the end of each lecture.

## Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for imore than 10 years. Over that time, I have tried
many different graphical shells for Git, without finding one that was easier
and nicer to use than the command-line (in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent
Git shell and would advise using it to everyone.
