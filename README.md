# Modern-React-and-Redux

Code from the Modern React and Redux couse by Stephen Grider at
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux)

## Progress

  107 - Pics app V2, complete

## Differences from Stephen

* My components are functional components with hooks, from lecture 74 onwards.

* My components are in a `src/components` directory.

* I usually destructure props, e.g. `const SeasonDisplay = ({ lat }) => ...`
  vs `const SeasonDisplay = (props) => ...`

* My pics application is split into two version directories: `PicsV1` and `PicsV2`.

* I rarely, if ever, use the name `payload` for the data contained in a Redux action.
  The exception to this is when using `redux-promise` which requires the promised data
  name to be `payload`.

### Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for imore than 10 years. Over that time, I have tried
many different graphical shells for Git, without finding one that was easier
and nicer to use than the command-line (in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent
Git shell and would advise using it to everyone.
